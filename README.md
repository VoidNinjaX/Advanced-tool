### Description:

This tool is the result of an exciting partnership between **Zulu Studios** and our development team. It merges the most advanced network scanning, vulnerability testing, password cracking, exploitation, and packet sniffing technologies into a single, unified security testing framework. The tool integrates **over 100 advanced security tools**, combining the power of tools like **Nmap, SQLMap, Metasploit, Hashcat, Wireshark**, and many more into one efficient, powerful package.

**Disclaimer:** The core tools are compiled as `.exe` files for distribution due to their advanced nature and potential dangers if mishandled. As this tool contains highly advanced and potentially dangerous capabilities, **we do not release the source code publicly** to prevent malicious use.

### Features:

#### 1. **Network Scanning**:
   - **Asynchronous Port Scanning**: Efficient, fast scanning of ports using asynchronous programming.
   - **Nmap Integration**: Full support for Nmapâ€™s advanced scanning techniques, including OS detection, version detection, and more.

#### 2. **Vulnerability Scanning**:
   - **SQL Injection and XSS Detection**: Identifies vulnerabilities in web applications with custom SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting tests.
   - **SQLMap Integration**: Automates SQL Injection attacks and database extraction with the powerful SQLMap tool.

#### 3. **Password Cracking**:
   - **Hashcat Integration**: Advanced password cracking capabilities with Hashcat, including support for MD5, SHA1, and other hash algorithms.
   - **Brute Force and Dictionary Attacks**: Perform high-efficiency brute force attacks on password hashes with customizable settings.

#### 4. **Exploitation Tools**:
   - **Metasploit Integration**: Leverage the Metasploit Framework for advanced exploitation tasks, including reverse shells and privilege escalation.
   - **Custom Exploit Generation**: Automatically generate payloads for remote exploitation using msfvenom.

#### 5. **Packet Sniffing and Spoofing**:
   - **Packet Sniffing**: Capture and analyze network traffic using built-in packet sniffing capabilities.
   - **ARP Poisoning and Spoofing**: Perform network-based attacks, including ARP poisoning, to intercept traffic between devices.

#### 6. **Real-Time Dashboard**:
   - Visualizes the status of your scans and exploits in real-time using graphical representations of open ports, vulnerabilities found, and passwords cracked.

#### 7. **Comprehensive Reporting**:
   - **HTML/JSON Report Generation**: Automatically generates detailed reports with scan results, vulnerabilities, and cracked passwords, providing easy-to-read summaries and logs.

#### 8. **And 93 more tools that wont be said for safty!**
